# Develop Assistant

![Develop Assistant](https://github.com/mrsarthak001/Developer-Assistant/blob/master/docs/DA.gif)

Our aim is to develop an assistant that works upon voice or text based
commands which helps the developer to upload/configure or launch the
services like AWS, Docker, GitHub, SQL and other applications in one go.

## Abstract

As technology continues to grow and expand, programmers or developers
need to keep up. Frameworks, tools, libraries, and commands become
outdated pretty quickly. Usually between two to three years, updated
versions come along.

In a sense, updated versions are good, because they are more efficient and
make jobs easier. But you also need to get used to them fast, something you may struggle with as a new developer. Veteran developers know, CLI commands and using quality tools can make them more productive and can also open doors to various approaches to automation that are far more practical with textual interfaces than with GUI apps.

Performing the same operations manually introduces both an added cognitive load and the increased possibility of human error. As usual, we rely on computers to handle tasks humans may find boring, repetitive, or
overwhelming.[2]

And such a task is learning commands and implementing them repeatedly
which is boring, so here we came with an assistant just like a google
assistant that weâ€™ve named Developer Assistant. It will perform all tasks like configuring, updating or launching services or applications in one go through text or voice inputs, thus helping developers.

***Keyword :*** *learning commands, Google Assistant, configure,
update, launch, text or voice input.*
